ETL-Inventory Stock Optimization
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing inventory management by automating the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow and Elasticsearch. The goal is to ensure efficient stock management by reducing out-of-stock and overstock issues, ultimately improving operational efficiency and cost management.

🚀 Key Features
- Automated ETL Pipeline: Extracts, transforms, and loads inventory data using Apache Airflow.
- Real-time Data Processing: Integrates Elasticsearch to enable fast querying and monitoring.
- Interactive Dashboards: Developed using Kibana to track inventory levels and trends.
- Stock Optimization: Identifies patterns in stock movement to prevent inefficiencies.

🛠 Tech Stack
- Python – Data processing & ETL scripting
- Apache Airflow – Workflow automation
- Elasticsearch – Data indexing & storage
- Kibana – Data visualization & dashboarding
- PostgreSQL – Database management

📊 Workflow Architecture
1. Extract: Retrieve inventory data from multiple sources (CSV, APIs, Databases).
2. Transform: Clean, aggregate, and structure the data for analysis.
3. Load: Store processed data into Elasticsearch for real-time monitoring.
4. Visualization: Generate insights through Kibana dashboards.

🔍 Results
- Improved inventory tracking, reducing stock shortages and surpluses.
- Enabled real-time monitoring of stock levels across multiple warehouses.
- Automated reporting and trend analysis for better decision-making.
